# TEM-Image-Segmentation-Using-a-CPU-Optimized-U-Net
Developed a machine learning model to perform multi-class segmentation on TEM images using a limited dataset. Implemented an architecturally lightweight U-Net model for semantic segmentation and used fewer convolutional channels to optimize performance on a computationally constrained machine. Uploaded is the final code file which contains the unet model and a formal written report which contains information on the problem statement, model architecture, learning strategy, optimization techniques and performance analysis. Provided below is a google drive link which contains the training dataset which includes raw and labelled images, the testing dataset which includes two raw images on which the model can run and produce outputs.
