# TEM-Image-Segmentation-Using-a-CPU-Optimized-U-Net
Developed a machine learning model to perform multi-class segmentation on TEM images using a limited dataset and CPU-only computational resources.  Implemented an architecturally lightweight U-Net model for semantic segmentation and used fewer convolutional channels to optimize performance on a computationally constrained machine.
