# TEM-Image-Segmentation-Using-a-CPU-Optimized-U-Net
Developed a machine learning model to perform multi-class segmentation on TEM images using a limited dataset and CPU-only computational resources.  Implemented an architecturally lightweight U-Net model for semantic segmentation and used fewer convolutional channels to optimize performance on a computationally constrained machine. Uploaded is training dataset which includes raw and labelled images, the testing dataset which includes two raw images on which the model can run and produce outputs, and also the final code file which contains the unet model.
